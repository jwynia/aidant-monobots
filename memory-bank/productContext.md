# Product Context

## Problem Space
The project addresses the need for specialized software agents that can perform specific tasks autonomously. This modular approach allows for focused development of individual agents while maintaining consistency through shared templates.

## Solution
Aidant Monobots provides a framework for creating and managing specialized software agents:
- Individual agents with specific capabilities
- Template system for consistent agent creation
- Research-focused agent implementation
- TypeScript-based architecture for type safety

## User Experience Goals
1. Developers should be able to:
   - Create new agents easily using templates
   - Implement specialized functionality for each agent
   - Maintain type safety throughout development
   - Extend agent capabilities as needed

2. End users should be able to:
   - Interact with agents for specific tasks
   - Benefit from research agent capabilities
   - Experience consistent behavior across different agents

## Key Features
1. Agent Template System
   - Standardized structure for new agents
   - Common patterns and utilities

2. Research Agent
   - Specialized capabilities for research tasks
   - Type-safe implementation

3. TypeScript Integration
   - Strong typing for all components
   - Enhanced development experience
