# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
1. Project Expansion
   - Implementing additional agent types
   - Enhancing existing agents
   - Developing testing framework

2. Documentation Enhancement
   - Updating README with current features
   - Improving API documentation
   - Creating usage examples

3. Integration Development
   - Creating agent orchestration system
   - Implementing shared utility functions
   - Developing deployment strategies

## Implemented Agents
1. CSS Selector Finder Agent
   - Web scraping with Puppeteer
   - Automatic selector generation and testing
   - Confidence scoring for recommendations
   - Multiple selector strategy suggestions

2. Research Agent
   - Perplexity Sonar integration for deep research
   - Markdown output with citations
   - Deployable to serverless environments
   - Comprehensive web research capabilities

## Recent Changes
1. Agent Implementation
   - Completed CSS Selector Finder agent
   - Completed Research agent
   - Enhanced agent template with robust error handling

2. Project Structure
   - Updated documentation
   - Organized codebase
   - Implemented consistent patterns across agents

## Next Steps
1. Short Term
   - Implement testing framework
   - Create data extraction agent
   - Enhance documentation

2. Medium Term
   - Develop additional agent types
   - Create shared utility library
   - Implement agent orchestration system

3. Long Term
   - Containerize agents for deployment
   - Implement monitoring and logging
   - Develop CI/CD pipeline

## Active Decisions
1. Architecture
   - Using TypeScript for type safety
   - Template-based agent development
   - ReACT pattern for all agents
   - Dual-mode operation (CLI and web server)

2. Development
   - Following strict type checking
   - Maintaining consistent documentation
   - Using template patterns for all agents
   - Implementing robust error handling

## Current Considerations
1. Technical
   - Optimizing agent performance
   - Improving error handling in edge cases
   - Enhancing type definitions
   - Implementing testing strategies

2. Development Process
   - Documentation standards
   - Code organization
   - Testing strategies
   - Deployment options
