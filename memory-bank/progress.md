# Progress Tracking

## What Works
1. Project Structure
   - Basic directory organization established
   - TypeScript configuration set up
   - Memory bank documentation created

2. Agent Template System
   - Robust template structure implemented
   - ReACT pattern implementation
   - Error handling with fallback mechanisms
   - Dual-mode operation (CLI and web server)
   - File output capabilities

3. CSS Selector Finder Agent
   - Fully implemented and functional
   - Puppeteer integration for web scraping
   - Automatic selector generation and testing
   - Confidence scoring for recommendations
   - Multiple selector strategy suggestions

4. Research Agent
   - Fully implemented and functional
   - Perplexity Sonar integration for deep research
   - Markdown output with citations
   - Deployable to serverless environments

## What's Left to Build
1. Additional Agents
   - Data extraction agent
   - Monitoring agent
   - Automation agent
   - Integration agent for connecting multiple agents

2. Enhanced Template System
   - Shared utility functions library
   - Improved type definitions
   - Better documentation generation

3. Testing
   - Set up testing framework
   - Create test patterns
   - Implement agent-specific tests

4. Deployment
   - Docker containerization
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Monitoring and logging
