# Project Brief: Aidant Monobots

## Overview
Aidant Monobots is a project focused on developing specialized software agents (monobots) that perform specific tasks. The project appears to be structured as a TypeScript-based system with individual agents and templates.

## Core Requirements
1. Create and maintain a collection of specialized software agents
2. Provide a template system for consistent agent creation
3. Enable research capabilities through dedicated agents
4. Maintain type safety through TypeScript implementation

## Goals
1. Establish a scalable architecture for agent development
2. Ensure consistent patterns across different agent implementations
3. Enable easy creation of new agents through templates
4. Maintain high code quality and type safety

## Project Scope
- Development of individual agent implementations
- Creation and maintenance of agent templates
- Research agent functionality
- TypeScript-based development environment
