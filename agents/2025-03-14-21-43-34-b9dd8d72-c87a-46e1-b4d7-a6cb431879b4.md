# Research: what dissolves superglue?

The most commonly recommended and effective solvent for dissolving super glue (cyanoacrylate adhesives) is acetone. Acetone works by breaking down the polymer chains in cured super glue, softening and ultimately dissolving it—often within a few minutes when using pure acetone. This effect is noticeable whether you’re using industrial-grade acetone or a nail polish remover that lists acetone as a key ingredient; however, note that many nail polish removers are diluted, which can reduce their effectiveness and result in a slower dissolution process. 

For applications on skin or delicate surfaces, caution is advised because acetone can be harsh—it may irritate or dry out the skin and can damage certain plastics or painted surfaces. In such cases, alternatives like warm soapy water may help mechanically loosen the glue over time (though they are much less effective chemically) or vegetable oils might assist slowly by penetrating the adhesive. 

Remember to always test the solvent on a small hidden area first and use protective gear (like gloves and adequate ventilation) when handling acetone to ensure safe removal and prevent unintended damage.
